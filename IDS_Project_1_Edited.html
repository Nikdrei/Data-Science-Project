# Introduction.


Communication has evolved and transformed the way in which we live nowadays, and
so have the tools we use for that purpose. Currently, the primary tool of communication
is the internet, whose impact is so significant we can say that thanks to it, the 
COVID-19 crisis impact has not been that strong within the society, no only
economically, but also in topics such as health, business, education, and others.
Together with the internet, cell phones, personal computers, and the broadband
are additional tools that come together with the package since they are also
needed for it.


Considering that, we will analyze how these tools have been adopted among some
countries and which ones are the ones leading in these categories. 

To target that goal, we will be working with the following tables:

1. Internet Users: Contains the percentage of population using the internet from
1960 to 2019.

2. Broadband Subscribers: Contains the number of people who is subscribed to a
broadband service per country, excluding people who have access to data 
communication via mobile-cellular networks. This information is from 1998 to 2019.

3. Personal Computers: Amount of personal computers per country from 1990
to 2006.

4. Cell phones: Amount of cell phones per country from 1960 to 2019.

5. Broadband in the USA: Contains the offered speed of each service provider 
in The USA in 2019.

Source of data 1 to 4: https://www.gapminder.org/data/

Source of data 5: https://opendata.fcc.gov/Wireline/Fixed-Broadband-Deployment-Data-December-2019/whue-6pnt


Below are displayed the first six rows of each table.

```{r, results='markup'}

t1 <- data.frame(read.csv("internet_users.csv"))

kable(head(t1),
  col.names = gsub("[X]", "", names(t1)),
  caption = "Table 1: Worldwide internet Users from 1960 to 2019.",
  "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)

t2 <- data.frame(read.csv("broadband_subscribers.csv"))

kable(head(t2),
  col.names = gsub("[X]", "", names(t2)),
  caption = "Table 2: Worldwide broadband subscribers from 1998 to 2019.",
  "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)

t3 <- data.frame(read.csv("personal_computers_total.csv"))

kable(head(t3),
  col.names = gsub("[X]", "", names(t3)),
  caption = "Table 3: Worlwide personal computers from 1990 to 2006.",
  "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)

t4 <- data.frame(read.csv("cell_phones_total.csv"))

kable(head(t4),
  col.names = gsub("[X]", "", names(t4)),
  caption = "Table 4: Worlwide cell phones from 1960 to 2019.",
  "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)

t5 <- data.frame(read.csv("BroadbandData_M.csv"))

kable(head(t5),
  col.names = gsub("[X]", "", names(t5)),
  caption = "Table 5: Broadband in The United States in 2019.",
  "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)

rows_t1 <- nrow(t1)
cols_t1 <- ncol(t1)

rows_t2 <- nrow(t2)
cols_t2 <- ncol(t2)

rows_t3 <- nrow(t3)
cols_t3 <- ncol(t3)

rows_t4 <- nrow(t4)
cols_t4 <- ncol(t4)

rows_t5 <- nrow(t5)
cols_t5 <- ncol(t)

```

The information in the whole tables is the following.

* Table 1:
    - `r rows_t1` rows.
    - `r cols_t1` columns.
  
* Table 2:
    - `r rows_t2` rows.
    - `r cols_t2` columns.

* Table 3:
    - `r rows_t3` rows.
    - `r cols_t3` columns.

* Table 4:
    - `r rows_t4` rows.
    - `r cols_t4` columns.
 
* Table 5:
    - `r rows_t5` rows.
    - `r cols_t5` columns.


To be more consistent with the analysis and the information, we will make sub-tables
of the original ones, since we will be focusing the analysis from the year 2000 to 2019.
Be aware that in the case of table 3, the analysis will be possible only until year
2006, since this is the last day from which we have information. The information
of the first six rows is displayed as well.

```{r}

t6 <- t1 [ , c(1, 42:61)]

kable(head(t6),
  col.names = gsub("[X]", "", names(t6)),
  caption = "Table 6: Worldwide internet Users from 2000 to 2019.",
  "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)

t7 <- t2 [ , c(1, 4:23)]

kable(head(t7),
  col.names = gsub("[X]", "", names(t7)),
  caption = "Table 7: Worldwide broadband subscribers from 2000 to 2019.",
  "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)

t8 <- t3 [ , c(1, 12:18)]

kable(head(t8),
  col.names = gsub("[X]", "", names(t8)),
  caption = "Table 8: Worlwide personal computers from 2000 to 2006.",
  "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)

t9 <- t4 [ , c(1, 42:61)]

kable(head(t9),
  col.names = gsub("[X]", "", names(t9)),
  caption = "Table 9: Worlwide cell phones from 2000 to 2019.",
  "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)

```

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).


Now let us calculate the summary statistics of tables 5 to 9 to have an overview
of the how the behavior has been in the topics we are working on.

```{r}

stats_t5 <- xkablesummary(t5, title = "Table 10: Summary Statistics of broadband service provided in The USA")
stats_t5

stats_t6 <- xkablesummary(t6, title = "Table 11: Summary Statistics of internet users from 2000 to 2019 in the world.")
stats_t6

stats_t7 <- xkablesummary(t7, title = "Table 12: Summary Statistics of broadband subscribers from 2000 to 2019 in the world.")
stats_t7

stats_t8 <- xkablesummary(t8, title = "Table 13: Summary Statistics of personal computers from 2000 to 2006 in the world.")
stats_t8

stats_t9 <- xkablesummary(t9, title = "Table 14: Summary Statistics of cell phones from 2000 to 2019 in the world.")
stats_t9

```

Overall, we see that on average the tendency to the use of broadband, internet,
personal computers, and cell phones has had an increase in the last 20 years,
7 in the case of personal computers.

When it comes to the broadband services that are offered in The USA in 2019, we 
see that on average, the downloading speed is 109 [mbps], while the upload speed 
is 29 [mbps]; therefore, we can say that it is faster for people in The USA to 
download information than upload it. When it comes to the maximum speed, both
things can be done at 1,000 [mbps] if needed. It would have been interesting to 
see how this service has improved over the years when it comes to speed
. Unfortunately, we do not have that information.

To better see the behavior in the topics we are analyzing, we created charts 1 to 4.

With the exception of chart 1, we see that there is a tendency in the other
three plots of some countries that are above the rest when it comes to growth
of each concept.

From chart 1 specifically, Table 15 presents the top ten countries when it comes
to the percentage of the population who use the internet. Additionally, The United States
is added at the end of the table since they are not in place eleven in this
topic. According to this table, internet usage has been led by European 
countries.

```{r, results='markup'}

t15 <- data.frame(read.csv("Top_Countries_Internet_Users.csv"))

kable(t15,
  col.names = gsub("[X]", "", names(t15)),
  caption = "Table 15: Top 10 countries in Internet Users.",
  "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)

```
Considering what has been presented in table 15, we will work now on the
following countries:

     1. Canada
     2. China
     3. Denmark
     4. Iceland
     5. Kuwait
     6. Mexico
     7. Norway
     8. Qatar
     9. South Korea
     10. The United Arab Eirates
     11. The United States
The United States, China, and Mexico have been added for the interest of the team.

In the following information, tables 15 to  18 contain the leading countries
in each of the previous categories. Additionally, charts 5 to 8 display how the
the growth of each type of technology tool has been in the years of interest.

Now let us see the statistics of the leading countries, results are presented in
table 15 to 17.

```{r}

stats_t15 <- xkablesummary(t15, title = "Table 19: Summary Statistics of top 10 countries in regarding internet usage")
stats_t15

stats_t16 <- xkablesummary(t16, title = "Table 20: Summary Statistics of top 10 countries in broadband subscribers.")
stats_t16

stats_t17 <- xkablesummary(t17, title = "Table 21: Summary Statistics of top 10 countries in personal computers usage.")
stats_t17

stats_t18 <- xkablesummary(t18, title = "Table 22: Summary Statistics of top 10 countries in cell phones usage.")
stats_t18

```

# Conclusions.

According to this analysis, there has undoubtedly been an increase in the tools used for communication. However, the development and use of these has not been the same in all countries;  this stands out in our tables and graphs.

These results must be considered with precaution since we are not considering each country's population. This is important because, in table 15, we see the leading countries in the use of the internet; however, the difference in population between Iceland and China or The United States is a factor that should be taken into account. Therefore, the challenges of each country for developing the needed infrastructure and technology are different.

The population is somehow highlighted in the charts and tables related to quantities since it is here where countries with a higher number of citizens are brought into the results.

Another interesting point from the analysis is that the development has not been constant among the years and beyond the change in each topic's leading places. It is essential to mention the fast growth rate that countries as China, United Arab Emirates, and Qatar have had. If we look at the data before the year 2000, The United States was the leading country in many of these topics, but there was a point in which it was exceeded by China. Additionally, The United Arab Emirates and Qatar had amazing growth after the year 2010.

Results of the broadband speed were also presented within this analysis. It would have been good to have information from other countries as well; unfortunately, this information was not available, but we can take as a reference these results from The United States and have in mind that they correspond to a country that has been able to lead its development of these communication tools within its high number of citizens.

Finally, together with each country's population's size, various challenges have an effect; Social, economic, and infrastructure impediments should be considered in future analysis. This is a topic that was not considered within this work. Still, we should be aware that these barriers are different in each country.
